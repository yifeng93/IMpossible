2. 可能的问题方向

3. 一起做的事情

   1. **personal question:** 

      - why did you start making video and why did you choose this genre (video reaction) ? 

      - what do you think is the most motivated/ annoying part for being a youtuber? 

      - did you choose the video by yourself/by your team/by fans? 

      - we've noticed that you started on Chinese media platforms in Mar 2020, the beginning of the pandemic, how was your life by then? 

   2. **the entertainment industry dynamic :** 

      - how much do you know about the Chinese entertainment industry, apart from the video you did reaction on? 

      - How does Asian pop culture attracts you? and how was it started? 

      - **optional :** since you did reaction on Youth with You, are you familiar with the Chinese famdom/ fan culture? did you encounter and cultural shock? What was your opinions? 

      - Chinese music industry: you seems to be overall positive on commenting the Chinese music shows, what do you think is the most unique part of Chinese industry that you like? 

      - Do you think there are any prominent problems of Chinese music industry at this moment? 

      - **optional:** about freedom of creativity: In some Chinese TV shows, the lyrics was modified to a "more gentle/less extreme" version (eg no mention of "death"), do you think this kind of adjustment would affect the freedom of creativity and in what way? 

      - Most of the videos are about the musician side of you, what about your filmmaker part? 

      - in the process of making your video, do you have the worry that it may trigger any disputes/ potential problems? Or do you have the moment that you feel like the current online environment is getting polarized? 

   3. **Inter-cultural communication**

      - People seem to be more enclosed in their own bubbles in recent years, are you worried about this and do you have any attempt to break the bubbles？
      - Chinese and German has completely different cultural background/origin, but you mentioned that both of us are "hardworking and disciplined", any other things that you think connects us together? 
      - As a German video maker active on Chinese platforms, you represents a collision/infusion of two cultures, I can see that you are also trying to introduce some German fun facts to audience, what do you think is the key importance of inter-cultural communication? 
      - At certain moment, do you  feel that you are being labelled on media platforms because of your background/identity/opinions? How do you see this? 
      - what are you plans for the future 
        - product video going back to tiktok instead of bilibili
        - funny catch-up, headline with douyin voiceover 
        - not good for monetizing for just doing music comments, finding new market on douyin

      - KEY QUESTION：Do you think the world is getting worse?

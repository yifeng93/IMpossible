## Felix的采访文稿样板

**假设Felix就是科隆大学那个做中国研究的教授（中文名文浩）**

### 1. 有关Felix

Felix是做当代中国研究的，对毛泽东思想在中国的影响方面有非常深的建树。目前是科隆大学东亚研究所的中国研究方向教授。Felix在中国多所高校都做过讲座。比如[2013年上海交通大学](https://history.sjtu.edu.cn/Web/Show/61)与[2018年复旦大学](https://icscc.fudan.edu.cn/e3/bc/c31627a385980/page.htm),同时他也活跃于自媒体和媒体。从[推特](https://twitter.com/felixwemheuer?lang=en)上面的信息看，他7月8日刚上传了YouTube的一次在线访谈视频。主要内容是毛泽东时期的经济和中国全球化的贸易之间的关系。[单击此链接](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGqQWw_Ki80&ab_channel=FelixWemheuerStudyingMaoistChina)。 

对于Felix的访谈，可能会着重在以下的点：

1. 什么样的契机使得自己做中国研究？在中国，有成千上万的学者研究欧美，但是在欧美可能研究中国的学者却不多。
2. 疫情期间Felix的个人经历。是否有感染过COVID-19，自己的教学和研究是否受到影响。
3. 作为中国研究的专家，Felix怎么看各个国家在此次疫情中的表现。（可以分前中后期）
4. 怎样从Felix的学科角度解读当下的中国。
5. Felix对当下的世界怎么看，有没有觉得这个世界变得更糟了。

### 2. 问题集

#### 2.1 有关Felix个人

1. According to the existing information I checked, you majored in East Asian Politics and China Studies at Ruhr University Bochum and Renmin University of China respectively during your studies. In the early 2000s, very few Europeans went to study in China, and you also majored in Chinese studies. I would like to ask what was the trigger or motivation that made you start modern China studies when you were a teenager? 
1. It's been more than two years since the COVID-19 pandemic, can you tell us about your experience in this global storm? For example, have you ever been infected?
1. I also saw from online resources that some of your courses have been recorded online. From my understanding, the study of liberal arts subjects actually requires a lot of practical communication. Do you think online courses have a great impact on your courses?
1. Do you have the majority of European students or the majority of Asian students in your program? Can you share an interesting student from your teaching career?

#### 2.2 有关疫情和中国

1. What do you think about the performance of various governments in different periods of this COVID-19?

2. Are you satisfied with Germany's epidemic prevention and control policies? What exactly did the government do? How effective is it?

3. As an expert in modern China studies, what do you think is the biggest misunderstanding between European and American countries and China?

   1. Did this misunderstanding manifest itself differently in different periods?
   2. In some of your lectures, you mentioned that if you want to understand modern China, you must first understand Mao Zedong's China. In the eyes of ordinary Westerners, what does modern China look like? What was China like under Mao Zedong？

#### 2.3 有关这个世界

1. This last question has nothing to do with your research, but with the subject of my interview and road trip. Do you think the world is getting worse and worse?
2. You have more experience than me. Have you ever been disappointed with the world? And what makes you hopeful about the world?

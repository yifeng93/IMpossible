## 1. Topics

Regarding the interview agenda with Huawei, we tentatively have the following three topics that intrigue us the most. One topic is more at the macro level and the other two at the micro level.

1. **What are the opportunities and challenges of Huawei-Germany, given the series of unexpected events happening in the western-Europe.**  We probably would take some major events happening in the recent two years (e.g., COVID-19, Russian-Ukraine conflict, rising energy costs and inflation etc.) as a starting point, and try to understand how Huawei-Germany has been working to tackle such events.
2. **Where is the future for young people？**This is a relatively micro-proposition, because the current world is complicated and young people are also facing confusion and dilemmas in life choices. From the perspective of Huawei executives, can we provide some advice to contemporary young people?
3. **Where does the "wolf culture" of Huawei-Germany stand on?** This is one central topic raised by Ren Zhengfei during a couple of interviews since 2020. From his perspective, he does not equate wolf culture with the typical 996, and insists that "almost all European countries are welcoming Huawei as their partner". Thus we are wondering, how the "wolf culture" has been presented and developed in the Europe.

## 2.  Interview scripts

In response to the above three topics, we have prepared three versions of interview scripts, which only include a few core questions, more might follow.

### 2.1 three years of up-and-downs

**Questions to Carsten**

1. The **COVID-19 crisis** has had a substantial impact on the EU economy. As a leading company in the telecom industry, how has the pandemic affected Huawei and could you please elaborate with a few examples. Are there any specific actions that Huawei has taken to mitigate the impact?
2. In 2020, there was conspiracy theory blaming 5g for the coronavirus, and some anti-intelligent statements that face masks contain 5g antennas. As a leader in the 5g tech industry, what were Huawei's opinions on such views? Did Huawei do anything regarding such spreading statements, if any, what?
3. After **US declared the trade war with China**, it seems that Huawei has become a chess piece in the us-china trade battleground. Many sanctions are directly targeted Huawei, such as the chip shortage and the detention of Meng Wenzhou. How does Huawei-Germany view these political-related difficulties in the development of the organization, and what did Huawei-Germany do? Do you think what might be the implications for other Chinese companies overseas?
4. In march this year, **football player Lewandowski ended his sponsorship with Huawei**. It was said that the main reason for him to cut ties was because "Huawei has been helping Russia in efforts to stabilize internet network against hacker attacks from the western world". Lewandowski left Bayern Munich as well. How did Huawei-Germany handle such event and what are the criteria to select a "brand ambassador"?
5. Europe is facing unprecedented **energy crisis and inflation in the eurozone** hits new records. The rising cost of living suggests that people might cut their spending on consumer electronics. How does Huawei view this? Does Huawei think it will impact its sales in this market? if yes, how does Huawei do as a response? If not, why not?
6. (The final question relates to our own project theme). Businesses today operate in an increasingly volatile, complex and dynamic environment. Politics are also full of uncertainties. What is your take on the current changing situations? Do you think the world is getting worse? We do not have any prior beliefs for this question, but would like to hear your opinions.



### 2.2 Where is the future for young people？

**Questions to Carsten**

1. For young people who are about to enter the job market or have just started working hard in the their works, what do you think will happen to their life choices under the changing times (or to be more specific post-COVID19 era)?

2. From are more realistic point of view, do you think the pandemic bring more opportunities or obstacles to the younger generation? 

3. What would you suggest the young generation to get prepared for these changes? regarding both hard skills and soft skills? physically and mentally?

4. Lastly, we know that you are a Chinese professional. From your personal perspectives, what do you think would be the most attractive part of Chinese culture? What makes you work in a Chinese company for such 11 years? Is it more realistic reasons (wages, promotion opportunities, company strcuture etc.), or you have more potential/hidden reasons? 



### 2.3 "wolf culture" of Huawei-Germany

**Questions to Carsten**

1. Do you know the wolf culture or the word? Do you think it is also practiced in Huawei Germany?

>任正非： “我们认为狼有三个特点：敏感性、团队性、不屈不挠性。”

2. Can you provide us with one or two cases that can reflect Huawei Germany's practice of "wolf culture"?
3. Where do you think the pro/cons of wolf culture are?



**Questions for Huawei employees**

1. What was the core reason for you to choose Huawei in the first place?
2. As an ordinary person living in Western Europe, what do you think is the most personal change that the environment has brought to you in the past two years, whether this change is good or bad?
3. In the current situation, do you think the world has gotten worse? why?
4. (If it is a Chinese employee) If you could say a word to our camera and bring it to your relatives, friends and loved ones in the distance, who would you say it and what would you say?





## 3. Filming needs

We would be grateful if there were colleagues from Huawei's media department who could cooperate with us to assist in the filming.
